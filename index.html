      <h2>&lbrace; About &rbrace;<span class='heading-sub-one'>Me</span></h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Jason! I am an asipring Front End Developer. I have been studing front end developement for about 1.5 years and have loved each minute of it. I had originally wanted to become a cartoonist since I loved creating somthing from scratch and making a beautiful image. I found my passion for Front End Development when taking a cohort that was offered at my job for develpment, from there everything changed. I loved that I could do the same thing with cartooning on a computer and create something amazing. From choosing the right persecitve of a layout, to the corresponding colors, to final product. Being a developer would be an amazing thing to be able to create and show everyone what I can do, and what can be done! </p>
